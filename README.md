## Scripts

### Manager Scripts

All managers can be accessed with Get() example TheGame.Get()

- [TheGame.cs](Assets/Scripts/TheGame.cs)

  *Core manager of the gameplay, contain function for loading and save the game. Will spawn saved objects when the scene starts, and will make the time progress and manage time speed.*

- [Interactable.cs](Assets/Scripts/Interactable.cs)

  *Allow characters to interact with it (with the right click). Can assign actions on this component, and worker will execute the first possible action in the list when right click*
- [UniqueID.cs](Assets/Scripts/UniqueID.cs)

- [Character.cs](Assets/Scripts/Character.cs)

  *Anything that can move and execute actions, including Worker.*
- [Selectable.cs](Assets/Scripts/Selectable.cs)

  *Basic components added to almost all interactable objects. Allow the object to be selected. This script is used by almost all other gameplay scripts.*
- [Worker.cs](Assets/Scripts/Worker.cs)

  *Workers are characters controlled by the player, and by the WorkerManager, they can be assigned to actions automatically or manually.*
- [WorkerAttribute.cs](Assets/Scripts/WorkerAttribute.cs)

  *This is the main data script that contains all the saved data. There is only one instance of this and it will be serialized when saving. It contains many useful functions to save, load, create a new game, or edit or access data.*

### Data Scripts
Data script are scriptable objects that define the structure of the data. These data file should be placed in the Resources folder so that TheData.cs load them automatically at the start of scene. Most data files are linked to a prefab that will be spawned when this object is created. To create data file: right click in Project files tab -> Create -> Farm Wolffun.

  *can be used to classify Selectables, or CraftData. And some actions will use groups to filter objects.*

### Action Scripts
Actions allow to define character interactions with objects in the game. Actions are also scriptable objects, but they contain a code logic for different types of actions that can be performed. There are Actions and Works which are a bit different. There are many different types of actions but they all inherit from the same two scripts.
Create a custom Action, inherit a new script from one of these two basic classes, and override the main functions.

- [ActionBasic.cs](Assets/Scripts/ActionBasic.cs)

  *Actions are specific commands that will be executed by a character. For example, eating, harvesting, building, sleeping. They usually target only 1 object and the action is performed by the character on 
that object (Selectable) when the character is within the use_range.*
- [WorkBasic.cs](Assets/Scripts/WorkBasic.cs)

  *Works can only be performed by worker, and can contain a series of automated actions (for example: move to house, harvest plant, bring it back to base, etc). Works are the things that are used by the WorkerManager to auto assign work to Workers.*
